## By the end of this lession you will

- Understand the fundamentals of Machine Learning optimization with gradient descent
- Understand basic implementations of gradient and stochastic gradient descent 
- Be able to implement your own simple linear and logistic regression using gradient descent in Python

- Understand the fundamentals of logistic regression
- Be able to implement your own model class that's just like sci-kit learns
